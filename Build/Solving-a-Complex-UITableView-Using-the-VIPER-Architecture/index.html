In this demonstration, we will see that VIPER can be very simple to implement and its benefits can be realized very quickly.</p><p>I’ll use the requirement from <a href="/Solving-a-Complex-UITableView-using-Swift">Solving a Complex UITableView using Swift</a> as the basis of this example. I’m going to refactor the solution of <a href="{Solving-a-Complex-UITableView-Even-More-Swiftly">Solving a Complex UITableView Even More Swiftly</a> into a VIPER solution. The complete App which demonstrates this refactoring can be found at <a href="https://github.com/lyleresnick/CleanReportTableDemo"><strong>CleanReportTableDemo</strong></a>.</p><p>We discussed how VIPER should be structured in <a href="/A-Crash-Course-on-the-VIPER-Architecture">A Crash Course on the VIPER Architecture</a>.</p><h2>The App</h2><p>You will see that to implement the solution as a VIPER module one must simply refactor what we have done so far.</p><h3>The ViewController</h3><p>As you can see the amount of code in the ViewController is very small. There is one call to the presenter. This call represents the event that the view is ready to receive output. It does not tell the presenter anything more than the fact that the event occurred. It is the presenter that determines what to do with the event. This is an example of forwarding, or a.k.a. <em>delegation</em> or <em>passing the buck</em>.</p><pre><code class="language-swift">class TransactionListViewController: UIViewController {

    var presenter: TransactionListPresenter!
    @IBOutlet fileprivate weak var tableView: UITableView!
    private var adapter: TransactionListAdapter!

    override func awakeFromNib() {
        super.awakeFromNib()
        
        TransactionListConnector(viewController: self).configure()
        adapter = TransactionListAdapter()
    }
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        tableView.dataSource = adapter
        
        presenter.eventViewReady()
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Three changes have been made to the ViewController:.</p><ul><li><code>awakeFromNib()</code> has been overridden,</li><li>a property called <code>presenter</code> has been added, and</li><li>a method called <code>showReport</code> has been added, which we will discuss later.</li></ul><p>Storyboards are a very important part of the Xcode workflow because of their visual layout and resultant documentation. Even though we are implementing VIPER, we would prefer to continue using Storyboards to define ViewController layouts.</p><p><code>awakeFromNib()</code> is called immediately after the ViewController is instantiated from the storyboard and the outlets are set. This is the perfect place to call the Connector to configure the remainder of the VIPER stack.</p><p>As mentioned previously, the VIPER stack must be configured, or more specifically, connected. The responsibility of configuration has been allocated to a class called a Connector.</p><p>You might have noticed that the <code>presenter</code> property has not been set. This is because it is set by the Connector.</p><h3>The Connector</h3><p>You might be wondering why the VIPER stack has to be configured by a third party class. It will become obvious when you look at the code. Remember that part of the requirement of the clean architecture is that it must be testable.</p><p>Certainly, you could arrange for the ViewController to directly allocate the Presenter and then have the ViewController set the presenter’s viewController as a delegate. This is pretty normal stuff. In the same way the Presenter could directly allocate the UseCase and then have the Presenter set the UseCase’s presenter as a delegate.</p><p>But what about the EntityGateway? Should we directly allocate this as well? Having the UseCase directly allocate the EntityGateway violates the rule that states: names of classes in the outer layer should not be known by classes of the inner layers. The only way to make this happen is to inject the EntityGateway into the UseCase.</p><p>The next question is: who should perform the injection? If the presenter does it, the rule is still violated. In fact none of the classes in the stack can perform the injection without violating the rule.</p><p>This is why the Connector has to do the injection of the EntityGateway into the UseCase.</p><pre><code class="language-swift">class TransactionListConnector {
    
    private let viewController: TransactionListViewController
    private let presenter: TransactionListPresenter
    private let useCase: TransactionListUseCase
    
    init(viewController: TransactionListViewController, useCase: TransactionListUseCase, presenter: TransactionListPresenter) {
        
        self.viewController = viewController
        self.useCase = useCase
        self.presenter = presenter
    }
    
    convenience init(viewController: TransactionListViewController, entityGateway: EntityGateway = EntityGatewayImpl()) {
        
        let useCase = TransactionListUseCase(entityGateway: entityGateway)
        let presenter = TransactionListPresenter(useCase: useCase)
        
        self.init(viewController: viewController, useCase: useCase, presenter: presenter)
    }
    
    func configure() {
        viewController.presenter = presenter
        useCase.output = presenter
        presenter.output = viewController
    }
}
</code></pre><p>With a view toward testability, the Presenter is injected into the UseCase as its output and the ViewController is injected into the Presenter as its output. Because the adapter is part of the view, it also needs a reference to the presenter.</p><h3>The Presenter</h3><p>In the previous version, the Adapter had two responsibilities:</p><ol><li>convert the data into a format suitable for display by the view and</li><li>respond to the tableView’s requests by delivering cells containing the formatted data. The first responsibility has been moved to the Presenter.</li></ol><p>The second responsibility is split by:</p><ol><li>making the Adapter a pure adapter between the tableView and the Presenter and</li><li>moving the remainder of the Adapter’s implementation to the Presenter.</li></ol><p>The name representing the rows has been changed to <code>TransactionListRowViewModel</code>s, because this is what they are known as in VIPER.</p><pre><code class="language-swift">class TransactionListPresenter {
    
    weak var output: TransactionListPresenterOutput!
    
    fileprivate static let outboundDateFormatter = DateFormatter.dateFormatter( format: "MMM' 'dd', 'yyyy" )

    private var rows = [TransactionListRowViewModel]()
    private var odd = false
    
    private let useCase: TransactionListUseCase
    
    init(useCase: TransactionListUseCase) {
        self.useCase = useCase
    }

    func eventViewReady() {
        useCase.eventViewReady()
    }
}
</code></pre><p>The presenter takes the ViewReady event and passes it on to the UseCase. This is an extremely trivial Presenter in terms of events. Most Presenters respond to many more user generated events after <code>eventViewReady</code> which are also passed to the UseCase.</p><p>In some circumstances, the Presenter will pass an event to a Router to access other ViewControllers.</p><p>All messages moving towards the UseCase (towards the centre of the architecture model) begin with the word <code>event</code>.</p><h3>The UseCase</h3><p>As mentioned before, the business logic is implemented by VIPER’s UseCase. Normally that is true, but as per the SRP, the work has been delegated to a Transformer class, owned by the UseCase.</p><pre><code class="language-swift">class TransactionListUseCase {

    weak var output: TransactionListUseCaseOutput!
    private let entityGateway: EntityGateway
    
    init(entityGateway: EntityGateway) {
        self.entityGateway = entityGateway
    }
    
    func eventViewReady() {
        
        let transformer = TransactionListViewReadyTwoSourceUseCaseTransformer(transactionManager: entityGateway.twoSourceManager)
        transformer.transform(output: output)
    }
}
</code></pre><p>The UseCase’s two methods are exactly the same as the two methods found in the ViewController of the previous version. As you already know from the previous post, they do almost exactly the same thing - we are using the <code>eventViewReady</code> method, now. We will discuss the <code>eventViewReadyOneSource</code> method another day.</p><p>You can see that the injected EntityGateway provides some opaque indirection w.r.t. the access of the transactions, whereas in the previous version, the transactions where accessed from a known location. Here, only the EntityGateway knows where they are located.</p><h3>The Transformer</h3><p>Except for some cosmetic naming changes, the Transformer called by the UseCase is identical to the previous version.</p><p>The naming of the output protocol methods have been changed to align it with the VIPER structure. The <code>TransactionListTransformerOutput</code> protocol is now called the <code>TransactionListViewReadyUseCaseOutput</code> protocol and the <code>append</code> methods have been renamed to <code>present</code> methods.</p><p>Two methods have been added to the protocol: <code>presentInit()</code> and <code>presentReport()</code>. These methods will allow the report to be regenerated so it can be refreshed. In the previous version, it was assumed that it would not be regenerated.</p><pre><code class="language-swift">protocol TransactionListViewReadyUseCaseOutput: class {
