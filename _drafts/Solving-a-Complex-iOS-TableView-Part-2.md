## Introduction

In part 1, I introduced a solution to solve A Complex tableView.

In part 2, I want to improve the Complex iOS TableView solution to simplify the code in three ways:

- remove more responsibilities from the ViewController,
- take advantage of a few key Swift features, and
- redistribute the conversion of both the input and output data.



## Responsibilities of the ViewController 

The main responsibility of a viewController is to configure the layout and content of its associated views  and respond  to user interaction with those views. Pretty straightforward.

In reality, most view controllers end up being a repository of all of the code that the view controller is dependent on, including aspects such as:

- data access, local or remote

- data conversion, from source or to display

- data transformation, such as grouping, summarizing or other more complex tasks

## Introducing the Transformer Class

In part 1, the viewController has a function named`transformFromTwoSources`. I have moved the implementation of this function to a class, `TransactionListTwoSourceTransformer`.

The viewController now looks like this: 

```swift
import UIKit

class TransactionListViewController: UIViewController {
    
    @IBOutlet private weak var tableView: UITableView!
    @IBOutlet private weak var adapter: TransactionListAdapter!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        transformFromTwoSources()
    }
    
    func transformFromTwoSources() {
        
        let transformer = TransactionListTwoSourceTransformer(authorizedData: TransactionModel.authorizedData,
                                                              postedData: TransactionModel.postedData)
        transformer.transform( output: adapter )
    }
}
```

You may have noticed that the viewController just got really small! It is only responsible for its views.

Before we take a look at the `TransactionListTwoSourceTransformer`, lets look at the `TransactionModel` and TransactionGroup classes.

## The Models

The `TransactionGroup` enum demonstrates an idiom for representing data whose values are part of a set. An `enum` can be based on an integer or string type. Every enum based on a raw type automatically generates an `init?(rawValue:)` initializer to convert a raw value to an internal value. 

Using the enum rawValue initializer is great a way to check the validity of externally stored data which actually represents an enumerated type such as a set of state names, a set of configuration values, or as in in our case, and encoding for a sign. The initializer is fail-able, so invalid data can be dealt with at conversion, instead of at a later stage of processing. In particular, the swift compiler will check that  `switch` statements that switch on enumerated types are exhaustive, so if a new external type is added in the future, the code will not compile if the new case is not added to the `switch`.  

```swift
enum TransactionGroup: String {
    
    case authorized = "A"
    case posted = "P"

    func toString() -> String {
        switch self {
        case .authorized:
            return "Authorized"
        case .posted:
            return "Posted"
        }
    }
}
```

In the original `TransactionModel` , each data value was stored as a string. Unless a value is supposed to be a string, you have to be convert a string to its primitive type to do a calculation. 

In the new `TransactionModel`, the data is stored as its primitive type. The Data is not converted in the transformer, before it is used in calculations.  The `TransactionModel` class now has the responsibility to perform any necessary conversions which are required to convert the external representation to the new internal representation. Previously, this was the responsibility of the transformation function. 

You can see that the `TransactionModel.init` converts:

- a group string into a group value
- a date string into a date value
- a debit indicator and an amount string into double value

Here a conversion error results in fatal error, but alternatively, you might make the init fail-able or you get more specific by throwing an error.

It is easy to see that another `convenience init` for this class could take json as an argument and pass the parsed elements to this `init`. 


```swift
struct TransactionModel {
    
    var group: TransactionGroup
    var date: Date
    var description: String
    var amount: Double
    
    private static let inboundDateFormatter = DateFormatter.dateFormatter( format:"yyyy'-'MM'-'dd")
    
    init( group: String, date: String, description: String, amount: String, debit: String ) {
        
        guard let group = TransactionGroup(rawValue: group) else {
            fatalError("Format of Group is incorrect")
        }
        self.group = group
        
        guard let date = TransactionModel.inboundDateFormatter.date( from: date )
            else {
                fatalError("Format of Transaction Date is incorrect")
        }
        self.date = date
        
        self.description = description
        
        var sign: String!
        switch debit
        {
        case "D":
            sign = ""
        case "C":
            sign = "-"
        default:
            fatalError("Format of Transaction Sign is incorrect")
        }
        
        guard let amount = Double(sign + amount)
            else {
                fatalError("Format of Transaction Amount is incorrect")
        }
        self.amount = amount
    }
}
```

## The Transformer

Previously, the data transformation was implemented as a viewController method. It has now been implemented as a *method object*. 

Besides encapsulating the code responsible for the transformation, `TransactionListTwoSourcesTransformer` has a few other significant changes:

- the data is passed into the class at initialization. This was done to make it easier to setup tests for the transformer .
- the group types have been encapsulated by the Group class. 
- the responsibility for conversion of input data has been moved to the `TransactionModel` class. 
- the responsibility for conversion of output data has been moved to the `TransactionListAdapter`. 
- the iterator on the array of transactions has been replaced with an `IndexingIterator`.â€‹

These changes leave the `TransactionListTwoSourceTransformer` with one responsibility: convert the primitive data input to primitive output by recognizing the date groupings and exceptions, as well as calculating a total and grand total. This is pretty simple. Actually, not quite: in a future post I let you in on how the code structure was designed!

```swift
import UIKit

class TransactionListTwoSourceTransformer {

    private let authorizedData: [TransactionModel]?
    private let postedData: [TransactionModel]?

    init( authorizedData: [TransactionModel]?, postedData: [TransactionModel]?) {
        self.authorizedData = authorizedData
        self.postedData = postedData
    }

    func transform(output: TransactionListTransformerOutput) {

        var grandTotal = 0.0
        grandTotal += transform( transactions: authorizedData, group: .Authorized, output: output)
        grandTotal += transform( transactions: postedData, group: .Posted, output: output )
        output.appendGrandFooter(grandTotal: grandTotal)
    }

    
    private func transform(transactions: [TransactionModel]?, group: TransactionGroup, output: TransactionListTransformerOutput ) -> Double {
        
        var total = 0.0
        output.appendHeader(group: group)
        
        if let transactions = transactions {
            
            if transactions.count == 0 {
                output.appendNoTransactionsMessage( group: group)
            }
            else {
                var transactionStream = transactions.makeIterator()
                var transaction = transactionStream.next()

                while let localTransaction = transaction {
                    
                    let currentDate = localTransaction.date
                    output.appendSubheader(date: currentDate)
                    
                    while let localTransaction = transaction, localTransaction.date == currentDate {
                        
                        let amount = localTransaction.amount
                        total += amount
                        output.appendDetail(description: localTransaction.description, amount: amount)
                        transaction = transactionStream.next()
                    }
                    output.appendSubfooter()
                }
                output.appendFooter(total: total)
            }
        }
        else {
            output.appendNotFoundMessage(group: group)
        }
        return total
    }
}
```



## The Adapter

The Adapter implements a significant change from the previous version. Previously, the Adapter Rows were implemented using structs - it now uses enums instead.

```swift
enum TransactionListRow {

    case header( title: String )
    case subheader( title: String, odd: Bool )
    case detail( description: String, amount: String, odd: Bool )
    case subfooter( odd : Bool )
    case footer( total: String, odd: Bool )
    case grandfooter(total: String )
    case message( message: String )
}
```

As you will see, this change s

You may be wondering where the `cellId` and `height` information has gone. Since each is constant related to a given case, they have been implemented as a readonly vars of the `TransactionListRow`.  Normally you would see them implemented with the enum. Here they have been moved to a private extension in the Adapter file, because the adapter is the only  class that needs the information. The move also allows the `CellId` cases to continue to be private.

Notice that, here, `cellId` returns a `String`. In the previous version, it returned a `CellId`. The implementation of the cellId is now completely encapsulated. It returns a function w

```swift
// in file TransactionListAdapter:

private extension TransactionListRow {

    var cellId: String {
        return {
            () -> CellId in
            switch self {
            case .header:
                return .header
            case .subheader:
                return .subheader
            case  .detail:
                return .detail
            case .message:
                return .message
            case .footer:
                return .footer
            case .grandfooter:
                return .grandfooter
            case .subfooter:
                return .subfooter
            }
        } ().rawValue
    }

    private enum CellId: String {

        case header
        case subheader
        case detail
        case subfooter
        case footer
        case grandfooter
        case message
    }

    var height: CGFloat {
        get {
            switch self {
            case .header:
                return 60.0
            case .subheader:
                return 34.0
            case .detail:
                return 18.0
            case .subfooter:
                return 18.0
            case .footer:
                return 44.0
            case .grandfooter:
                return 60.0
            case .message:
                return 100.0
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Notice that the Adapter is no longer responsible for converting input data, such as the inboundDate, to primitive types. 



```swift
class TransactionListAdapter: NSObject {
    
    fileprivate var rowList = [TransactionListRow]()
    fileprivate var odd = false
}

// MARK: - TransactionTransformerOutput

extension TransactionListAdapter: TransactionListTransformerOutput {

    private static let outboundDateFormatter = DateFormatter.dateFormatter( format: "MMM' 'dd', 'yyyy" )

    func appendHeader(group: TransactionGroup ) {
        
        rowList.append(.header(title: group.toString()))
    }
    
    func appendSubheader( date: Date ) {
    
        odd = !odd;
        let dateString = TransactionListAdapter.outboundDateFormatter.string(from: date)
        rowList.append(.subheader(title: dateString, odd: odd))
    }
    
    func appendDetail( description: String, amount: Double) {
    
        rowList.append( .detail(description: description, amount: amount.asString, odd: odd));
    }
    
    func appendSubfooter() {
    
        rowList.append(.subfooter( odd: odd ));
    }
    
    func appendFooter( total: Double) {
    
        odd = !odd;
        rowList.append(.footer(total: total.asString, odd: odd));
    }
    
    func appendGrandFooter(grandTotal: Double) {
        
        rowList.append(.grandfooter(total: grandTotal.asString))
    }
    
    func appendNotFoundMessage(group: TransactionGroup) {
    
        rowList.append(.message(message: "\(group.toString()) Transactions are not currently available." ));

    }
    
    func appendNoTransactionsMessage(group: TransactionGroup) {
        
        rowList.append(.message(message: "There are no \(group.toString()) Transactions in this period" ));
    }
    
    func appendNotFoundMessage() {
        
        rowList.append(.header(title: "All"))
        rowList.append(.message(message: "Transactions are not currently available." ));
    }
}

// MARK: -

extension Double {
    var asString: String {
        return String(format: "%0.2f", self)
    }
}

// MARK: - UITableViewDataSource

extension TransactionListAdapter: UITableViewDataSource {
    
    func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
        return rowList.count
    }
    func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
        
        let row = rowList[ indexPath.row ]
        let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: row.cellId, for: indexPath)
        (cell as! TransactionListCell).bind(row: row)
        return cell
    }
}

// MARK: - UITableViewDelegate

extension TransactionListAdapter: UITableViewDelegate {
    
    func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, heightForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> CGFloat {
        return rowList[ indexPath.row ].height
    }
}

```
