## Introduction

In part 1, I introduced a solution to solve A Complex tableView.

In part 2, I want to improve the Complex iOS TableView solution to simplify the code in three ways:

- remove more responsibilities from the ViewController,
- take advantage of a few key Swift features, and
- redistribute the conversion of both the input and output data.



## Responsibilities of the ViewController 

The main responsibility of a viewController is to configure the layout and content of its associated views  and respond  to user interaction with those views. Pretty straightforward.

In reality, most view controllers end up being a repository of all of the code that the view controller is dependent on, including aspects such as:

- data access, local or remote

- data conversion, from source or to display

- data transformation, such as grouping, summarizing or other more complex tasks

## Introducing the Transformer Class

In part 1, the viewController has a function named`transformFromTwoSources`. I have moved the implementation of this function to a class, `TransactionListTwoSourceTransformer`.

The viewController now looks like this: 

```swift
import UIKit

class TransactionListViewController: UIViewController {
    
    @IBOutlet private weak var tableView: UITableView!
    @IBOutlet private weak var adapter: TransactionListAdapter!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        transformFromTwoSources()
    }
    
    func transformFromTwoSources() {
        
        let transformer = TransactionListTwoSourceTransformer(authorizedData: TransactionModel.authorizedData,
                                                              postedData: TransactionModel.postedData)
        transformer.transform( output: adapter )
    }
}
```

You may have noticed that the viewController just got really small! It is only responsible for its views.

Before we take a look at the `TransactionListTwoSourceTransformer`, lets look at the `TransactionModel` and TransactionGroup classes.

## The Models

The `TransactionGroup` enum demonstrates an idiom for representing with data whose values are part of a set. You can use `TransactionGroup(rawValue:)` to convert an external value to an internal one, so it is really convenient to convert the values and use them directly as enums. This is a great paradigm for converting externally stored state values to internal ones. The initializer is failable, so invalid data can be dealt with at conversion.

```swift
enum TransactionGroup: String {
    case authorized = "A"
    case posted = "P"
    case all = "0"

    func toString() -> String {
        switch self {
        case .authorized:
            return "Authorized"
        case .posted:
            return "Posted"
        case .all:
            return "All"
        }
    }
}
```

The `TransactionModel` class has been changed to represent the data in the form to be used in calculations.  The class is given the responsibility to perform any necessary conversions which are required to convert the raw form to the new internal form. Previously, this was the responsibility of the transformation function. 

You can see that the transaction model converts:

- a group string into a group value
- a date string into a date value
- a debit indicator and an amount string into double value

Here a conversion error results in fatal error, but alternatively, you might make the init fail or get more specific by throwing an error.

Another `init` for this class could take json and pass the parsed elements to this `init`. 


```swift
struct TransactionModel {
    
    var group: TransactionGroup
    var date: Date
    var description: String
    var amount: Double
    
    private static let inboundDateFormatter = DateFormatter.dateFormatter( format:"yyyy'-'MM'-'dd")
    
    init( group: String, date: String, description: String, amount: String, debit: String ) {
        
        guard let group = TransactionGroup(rawValue: group) else {
            fatalError("Format of Group is incorrect")
        }
        self.group = group
        
        guard let date = TransactionModel.inboundDateFormatter.date( from: date )
            else {
                fatalError("Format of Transaction Date is incorrect")
        }
        self.date = date
        
        self.description = description
        
        var sign: String!
        switch debit
        {
        case "D":
            sign = ""
        case "C":
            sign = "-"
        default:
            fatalError("Format of Transaction Sign is incorrect")
        }
        
        guard let amount = Double(sign + amount)
            else {
                fatalError("Format of Transaction Amount is incorrect")
        }
        self.amount = amount
    }
}
```

Now lets look at the `TransactionListTwoSourceTransformer` class:

```swift
import UIKit

class TransactionListTwoSourceTransformer {

    private let authorizedData: [TransactionModel]?
    private let postedData: [TransactionModel]?

    init( authorizedData: [TransactionModel]?, postedData: [TransactionModel]?) {
        self.authorizedData = authorizedData
        self.postedData = postedData
    }

    func transform(output: TransactionListTransformerOutput) {

        var grandTotal = 0.0
        grandTotal += transform( transactions: authorizedData, group: .Authorized, output: output)
        grandTotal += transform( transactions: postedData, group: .Posted, output: output )
        output.appendGrandFooter(grandTotal: grandTotal)
    }

    
    private func transform(transactions: [TransactionModel]?, group: TransactionGroup, output: TransactionListTransformerOutput ) -> Double {
        
        var total = 0.0
        output.appendHeader(group: group)
        
        if let transactions = transactions {
            
            if transactions.count == 0 {
                output.appendNoTransactionsMessage( group: group)
            }
            else {
                var transactionStream = transactions.makeIterator()
                var transaction = transactionStream.next()

                while let localTransaction = transaction {
                    
                    let currentDate = localTransaction.date
                    output.appendSubheader(date: currentDate)
                    
                    while let localTransaction = transaction, localTransaction.date == currentDate {
                        
                        let amount = localTransaction.amount
                        total += amount
                        output.appendDetail(description: localTransaction.description, amount: amount)
                        transaction = transactionStream.next()
                    }
                    output.appendSubfooter()
                }
                output.appendFooter(total: total)
            }
        }
        else {
            output.appendNotFoundMessage(group: group)
        }
        return total
    }
}
```

Besides encapsulating the code responsible for the transformation, `TransactionListTwoSourcesTransformer` has a few other significant changes:

- the data is passed into the class at initialization. This was done to make it easier to setup tests for the transformer.

- the group types have been encapsulated by the Group class. 

- the responsibility for conversion of input data has been moved to the `TransactionModel`class. 

- the iterator on the array of transactions has been formalized, by using an `IndexingIterator`.
