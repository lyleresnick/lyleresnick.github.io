## Introduction

In part 1, I introduced a solution to solve A Complex tableView.

In part 2, I want to improve the Complex iOS TableView solution to simplify the code in three ways:

- remove more responsibilities from the ViewController,
- take advantage of a few key Swift features, and
- redistribute the conversion of both the input and output data.



## Responsibilities of the ViewController 

The main responsibility of a viewController is to configure the layout and content of its associated views  and respond  to user interaction with those views. Pretty straightforward.

In reality, most view controllers end up being a repository of all of the code that the view controller is dependent on, including aspects such as:

- data access, local or remote

- data conversion, from source or to display

- data transformation, such as grouping, summarizing or other more complex tasks

## Introducing the Transformer Class

In part 1, the viewController has a function named`transformFromTwoSources`. I have moved the implementation of this function to a class, `TransactionListTwoSourceTransformer`.

The viewController now looks like this: 

```swift
import UIKit

class TransactionListViewController: UIViewController {
    
    @IBOutlet private weak var tableView: UITableView!
    @IBOutlet private weak var adapter: TransactionListAdapter!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        transformFromTwoSources()
    }
    
    func transformFromTwoSources() {
        
        let transformer = TransactionListTwoSourceTransformer(authorizedData: TransactionModel.authorizedData,
                                                              postedData: TransactionModel.postedData)
        transformer.transform( output: adapter )
    }
}
```

You may have noticed that the viewController just got really small! It is only responsible for its views.

Before we take a look at the `TransactionListTwoSourceTransformer`, lets look at the `TransactionModel` and TransactionGroup classes.

## The Models

First the `TransactionGroup`: 

```swift
enum TransactionGroup: String {
    case Authorized = "A"
    case Posted = "P"
    case All = "0"

    func toString() -> String {
        switch self {
        case .Authorized:
            return "Authorized"
        case .Posted:
            return "Posted"
        case .All:
            return "All"
        }
    }
}
```

Next, the `TransactionListTwoSourceTransformer`: 


```swift
struct TransactionModel {
    
    var group: TransactionGroup
    var date: Date
    var description: String
    var amount: Double
    
    private static let inboundDateFormatter = DateFormatter.dateFormatter( format:"yyyy'-'MM'-'dd")
    
    init( group: String, date: String, description: String, amount: String, debit: String ) {
        
        guard let group = TransactionGroup(rawValue: group) else {
            fatalError("Format of Group is incorrect")
        }
        self.group = group
        
        guard let date = TransactionModel.inboundDateFormatter.date( from: date )
            else {
                fatalError("Format of Transaction Date is incorrect")
        }
        self.date = date
        
        self.description = description
        
        var sign: String!
        switch debit
        {
        case "D":
            sign = ""
        case "C":
            sign = "-"
        default:
            fatalError("Format of Transaction Sign is incorrect")
        }
        
        guard let amount = Double(sign + amount)
            else {
                fatalError("Format of Transaction Amount is incorrect")
        }
        self.amount = amount
    }
}
```

Now lets look at the `TransactionListTwoSourceTransformer` class:

```swift
import UIKit

class TransactionListTwoSourceTransformer {

    private let authorizedData: [TransactionModel]?
    private let postedData: [TransactionModel]?

    init( authorizedData: [TransactionModel]?, postedData: [TransactionModel]?) {
        self.authorizedData = authorizedData
        self.postedData = postedData
    }

    func transform(output: TransactionListTransformerOutput) {

        var grandTotal = 0.0
        grandTotal += transform( transactions: authorizedData, group: .Authorized, output: output)
        grandTotal += transform( transactions: postedData, group: .Posted, output: output )
        output.appendGrandFooter(grandTotal: grandTotal)
    }

    
    private func transform(transactions: [TransactionModel]?, group: TransactionGroup, output: TransactionListTransformerOutput ) -> Double {
        
        var total = 0.0
        output.appendHeader(group: group)
        
        if let transactions = transactions {
            
            if transactions.count == 0 {
                output.appendNoTransactionsMessage( group: group)
            }
            else {
                var transactionStream = transactions.makeIterator()
                var transaction = transactionStream.next()

                while let localTransaction = transaction {
                    
                    let currentDate = localTransaction.date
                    output.appendSubheader(date: currentDate)
                    
                    while let localTransaction = transaction, localTransaction.date == currentDate {
                        
                        let amount = localTransaction.amount
                        total += amount
                        output.appendDetail(description: localTransaction.description, amount: amount)
                        transaction = transactionStream.next()
                    }
                    output.appendSubfooter()
                }
                output.appendFooter(total: total)
            }
        }
        else {
            output.appendNotFoundMessage(group: group)
        }
        return total
    }
}
```

Besides encapsulating the code responsible for the transformation, `TransactionListTwoSourcesTransformer` has a few other significant changes:

- the data is passed into the class at initialization. This was done to make it easier to setup tests for the transformer.

- the group types have been encapsulated by the Group class. 

- the responsibility for conversion of input data has been moved to the `TransactionModel`class. 

- the iterator on the array of transactions has been formalized, by using an `IndexingIterator`.
