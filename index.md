# I'm Lyle Resnick

I develop iOS and Android mobile applications. I think software code quality is very important. 

Currently, my primary interests are *Clean Mobile Architecture* and *Test Driven Development*. My experience has shown me that these two techniques work well together to produce software that is easy to change and free of bugs.

I have over thirty years of software experience.  Some of my major technical accomplishments include the development of commercial compilers, window systems, and forms frameworks for both desktop & mobile. 

I have written a lot of software. In Mobile development, I have acted as development lead and developer of apps for:

- Social Networking
- Banking
- Insurance
- Retail, and 
- Restaurant

In web and desktop development, I have acted as development lead and developer of applications for:

- Restaurant
- Commercial Foreign Exchange
- Securities, and
- Banking
