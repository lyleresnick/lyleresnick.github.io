# Hi there, I'm Lyle Resnick!

These days I develop iOS and Android mobile applications. 
My current primary interest is *Clean Mobile Architecture* and *Test Driven Mobile Development*. 

I think software code quality is very important, and I really like how these two techniques contribute to creating software that easy to change and is free of bugs.

I have over thirty years of software experience.  Some of my major technical accomplishments include the development of commercial compilers, window systems, and forms libraries for both desktop & mobile. 

I have written a lot of software.  In Mobile development, I have acted as development lead and developer of apps for:

- Social Networking
- Banking
- Insurance
- Retail, and 
- Restaurant

In web and desktop development, I have acted as development lead and developer of applications for:

- Restaurant
- Commercial Foreign Exchange
- Securities, and
- Banking
